def set_module_as(module: str) -> Callable[[T], T]:
    """Decorator overriding the ``__module__`` of a function or class.

    Reassigning ``__module__`` makes an object appear to belong to its public
    module (e.g. ``brainpy.state``) in documentation, ``repr`` and ``help``
    output, even though it is implemented in a private submodule. Both
    functions and classes are supported; the decorated object is returned
    unchanged apart from its ``__module__`` attribute.

    Parameters
    ----------
    module : str
        Public module path to assign, e.g. ``'brainpy.state'``.

    Returns
    -------
    callable
        A decorator that sets ``__module__`` on the function or class it wraps
        and returns it unchanged.
